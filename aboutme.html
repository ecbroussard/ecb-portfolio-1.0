  <h2>Career Objectives</h2>
    
        <p>Hi, my name is Elaine Broussard, and I am currently seeking an internship and/or full-time employment in public relations, editorial production, graphic design, web design or a similar field. By the end of the summer, I will earn a post-baccalaureate certificate in digital design from Tulane University. My interest in design stems from my desire to tell stories. With a background in print journalism, I have mastered methods of telling stories with words. Now I'm exploring the art of storytelling through visuals.</p>
        <p>I believe a message is more likely to be conveyed if the delivery mechanism is visually appealing. My ultimate goal is to marry my gift for words with my gift for visuals and enter the field of multimedia journalism. My unique mix of skills will prove valuable for media companies adapting to the digital age.</p>
        <p>On this site you'll see samples of my work in a variety of media. My articles and academic papers indicate my strong traditional media skills in writing and copy editing while my image samples demonstrate my proficiency in software applications such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Dreamweaver. Please view my resume and portfolio to determine my eligibility for employment at your organization. Thank you for your time.</p>

  <h2>Biography</h2>
 
  		<p>I grew up in Pride, La., a tiny town in East Baton Rouge Parish. In 2002, I graduated from Redemptorist High School in Baton Rouge and went on to attend the Louisiana Scholars' College at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, La. I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism in 2006 and began work as a newspaper reporter and copy editor. In 2009, I returned to academia and entered an alternative certification program for secondary teachers. In 2010, I graduated with a Master of Arts in teaching from Louisiana State University.</p>
        <p>I have spent the past three years as a high school English and journalism teacher, but now I am contemplating a career move back into the media/communications field. This desire has led me to enroll in the Digital Design program at Tulane University to strengthen my online skills, a gap left by my traditional print media education. After graduating in August 2014, I plan to become a multimedia journalist and author.</p>
