<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>Please consider this CV for the position of Curator Educator that is advertised on idealist.com. As a lifelong resident of Louisiana, I have a great appreciation for the rich heritage that our state celebrates. Throughout my career as a high school history teacher, I have transformed my passion for history and culture into rich meaningful curriculum. I am proud that many of my students have pursued history major/minors in college. Educators have a challenging task of keeping lessons interesting and relevant to an evolving student population. My involvement in educational technology gave me great experience in modernization lessons for today’s students. This outside of the box thinking led me to write online courses, create night classes, and establish school clubs, to promote social studies education. Today’s teacher is often overwhelmed by new curriculum and strategies. My experience as an Advanced Placement World History teacher has kept me on the cutting edge of curriculum and strategies with an emphasis on primary sources such as those available at the Historic New Orleans Collection. New Orleans is important to both American and World History. This year I asked my students to make their own scavenger hunt throughout the city looking for evidence of key people in history like Simon Bolivar, Joan of Arc, and Napoleon. Local teachers need to utilize this historic city as a living museum.  As a teacher of the gifted, I am required to work with teachers from all subject areas to enrich and their lesson plans to support academically gifted learners. This experience will help me work with teachers of all grade levels and subject areas throughout the region. I would love to help classroom teachers use the vast resources of the New Orleans Historic Collection create rigorous and engaging classroom activities. Instead of passive learning the artifacts available at the NOHC allow learners of all ages and backgrounds to actively “do” history.</p>
<p>The New Orleans Historic Collection has a special interest to me. My commitment to the field of history goes beyond a job. It is my hobby. I spend my weekends touring the antique shops of Royal St. or visiting the neighborhoods of the city.  Having strong roots in New Orleans, I grew up going to New Orleans public libraries helping my father trace our genealogy. I have collected centuries of stories from this city: my great Uncle George who walked in chest-high water from the Rigolets to the city after Hurricane Betsy, my great-great grandfather Narcisse Brunet, a Frenchman who made shoes on Rampart St when the French Quarter predominately populated by French people, and the DH Holmes clock on Canal St, where my grandmother was waiting for my grandfather after he returned from World War II, to accept his marriage proposal.  These are examples of how I am part of the history of this community. I have given informational and personal tours of the city to many New Orleans visitors. My lifetime of learning and my practical experiences writing and teaching new curriculum, could transform the educational mission of the New Orleans Historic Collection. I look forward to learning more about this position.<br>

  <p>Dear Sir or Madam:</p>
  <p>Please consider this curriculum vitae for the position of Curator of Education as advertised on idealist.com. As a lifelong resident of Louisiana, I have a great appreciation for the rich heritage our state celebrates. Throughout my career as a high school history teacher, I have transformed my passion for history and culture into rich, meaningful curricula. I am proud that many of my students have pursued history majors and minors in college because of my influence.</p>
  <p>Educators have a challenging task of keeping lessons interesting and relevant to an evolving student population, but I have always tackled this task with passion and enthusiasm. My involvement in educational technology gave me great experience in modernizing lessons for today’s students. This outside-of-the-box thinking led me to write online courses, create night classes, and establish school clubs to promote social studies education. Today’s teacher is often overwhelmed by new curriculumstrategies, but my experience as an Advanced Placement World History teacher has kept me on the cutting edge of curriculum strategies with an emphasis on primary sources such as those available at the Historic New Orleans Collection.</p>
  <p>New Orleans is important to both American and World History. This year I asked my students to make their own scavenger hunts throughout the city, looking for evidence of key people in history such as Simon Bolivar, Joan of Arc and Napoleon. I would love the opportunity to teach local teachers how to utilize this historic city as a living museum.</p>
  <p>As a gifted and talented coordinator, I am required to work with teachers of all subject areas to enrich their lessons to support academically gifted learners. The Curator of Education job would be an extension of that goal – to work with teachers of all grade levels and subject areas throughout the region to challenge and engage their students. If chosen for this position, I would teach classroom teachers how to use the vast resources of the New Orleans Historic Collection to create rigorous and engaging activities. Instead of participating in passive learning, learners of all ages and backgrounds will be able to actively “do” history through interaction with the artifacts available at the NOHC.</p>
  <p>The New Orleans Historic Collection is of special interest to me. My commitment in the field of history goes beyond a job – it is my hobby. I spend my weekends touring the antique shops of Royal St. and visiting the diverse neighborhoods of the city. Having strong roots in New Orleans, I grew up helping my father trace our genealogy through the New Orleans Public Libraries. I have collected centuries of stories from this city, such as my great Uncle George who walked in chest-high water from the Rigolets to the city after Hurricane Betsy, my great-great grandfather Narcisse Brunet, a Frenchman who made shoes on Rampart St. when the French Quarter was predominately populated by the French, and my grandmother, who stood at the D. H. Holmes Clock on Canal St., waiting to accept my grandfather’s marriage proposal after he returned from World War II. These are examples of how my ancestry is a part of the history of this community. Now, I am actively working to be part of its future.</p>
  <p>My lifetime of learning and my practical experiences writing and teaching new curricula could transform the educational mission of the New Orleans Historic Collection. I look forward to learning more about this position.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>Jane Doe, M.Ed.<br>
