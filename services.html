  <h2>Services can help rape victims:<br>
      Agencies, new programs respond to July jump in area reports</h2>
         <p><strong>Published Aug. 21, 2005, in the Lake Charles <em>American Press</em></strong><br>
        <br>
        A young woman walks to her car in a dark parking lot. She  sees no one around. A stranger grabs her from behind.<br>
        <br>
        This is the classic scenario for rape. But according to Nina  Delome and Kelli Barnes of Rape Crisis Outreach in Lake Charles, it is also a  stereotype.<br>
        <br>
        Delome and Barnes said the notion that women are always  raped by strange men in dark, secluded places is inaccurate. In fact, Barnes  said, there were recently two local cases of rape that happened in busy parking  lots in broad daylight.<br>
        <br>
        Delome, the program&rsquo;s director, said there were 21 cases of  rape reported in Calcasieu Parish in July. The average number of reported cases  per month is about eight.<br>
        <br>
        The local branch of Rape Crisis Outreach serves Calcasieu,  Allen, Beauregard, Cameron and Jeff Davis parishes. Barnes, who is an educator  and trainer for the program, said she doubts there have been a monthly total of  21 cases of rape reported in the five-parish area during the nine years she has  worked there. <br>
        <br>
        Delome said the 21 cases all involved hospital examinations.  Anonymous phone calls received by the center and late-reporting victims were  not included in the total.<br>
       <br> Six of the cases were children, nine were between the ages  of 18 and 24, and six were between 25 and 40.<br>
        <br>
        Of the 21 cases, three were reported as incest, two as rape  by a stranger, 11 as rape by an acquaintance or intimate partner, two as rape  by both a stranger and an acquaintance and three as rape in jail.<br>
        <br>
        Eighteen of the people who reported rape were women; three  were men.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>A team response</strong><br>
        When rape occurs, victims may be in shock and not know where  to turn.<br>
        <br>
        In participation with a national program funded by the U.S.  Department of Justice, Southwest Louisiana has an active Sexual Assault  Response Team. This means that all area agencies who respond to sexual assaults  coordinate their actions to better serve the victims. They include counseling  services, police agencies, hospitals and prosecutors.<br>
        <br>
        One component of the SART is the Sexual Assault Nurse  Examiner program. The Southwest Louisiana program is coordinated by registered  nurse Tammy Bailey at Lake Charles Memorial Hospital.<br>
        <br>
        Bailey said the locale SANE-SART program was born in 2001  when representatives of Rape Crisis Outreach, local police agencies, Lake  Charles Memorial Hospital, and the Calcasieu District Attorney&rsquo;s Office met to  put together a plan. They researched other programs in the nation, adopted some  of their policies and drafted some of their own.<br>
        <br>
        Bailey said one of the most important benefits of the  program is that victims don&rsquo;t have to keep retelling their stories like they  used to. A Rape Crisis Outreach counselor, a SANE nurse and a law enforcement  official can meet at the hospital and document the victim&rsquo;s story at the same  time.<br>
        <br>
        Because it is important for rape victims to come to the  hospital before bathing, eating, drinking, douching or changing clothes so that  valuable evidence is not destroyed, the Rape Crisis Outreach counselor supplies  a change of clothes and hygiene products.<br>
        <br>
        There is now a private room for sexual assault victims at  Lake Charles Memorial Hospital. Bailey said the room gives victims a quieter,  more confidential waiting area, so they no longer have to wait in the busy  emergency room.<br>
        <br>
  &ldquo;They were waiting in the general public with Joe Smith who  had a leg injury,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;As you know, emergency departments are going to  take the most critically injured first. Well, rape victims were not considered  emergency patients because most of them don&rsquo;t have visible injuries. Sometimes  they would wait up to six hours before being seen. Now we have a place they can  go right away.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
        There are nurses specially trained to give rape  examinations. These nurses volunteer to stay on call and are prepared to report  to the hospital quickly if a rape occurs.<br>
        <br>The hospital also has a special piece of equipment called a  colposcope, which is a camera used in rape examinations to find microscopic  tears in genital tissue.<br>
        <br>
  &ldquo;It can show that the patient has injuries consistent with  blunt-force trauma; we can&rsquo;t say rape, because that&rsquo;s the ultimate answer for  the jury to say,&rdquo; she said.<br>
        <br>According to U.S. Department of Justice statistics,  communities with SANE programs have a higher percentage of guilty pleas from  sexual assault defendants than those that do not.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Treating the children</strong><br>
        The subject of child sexual abuse can be baffling. Why do  perpetrators perform sexual acts on children too young to have sexual  tendencies?<br>
        <br>Delome said rape is not about sex. It is about control.<br>
        <br>
  &ldquo;If you have somebody who wants to exert power over  somebody, they&rsquo;re looking for somebody they&rsquo;re going to have success doing that  with,&rdquo; Delome said. &ldquo;Who is more helpless and defenseless than a child?&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
        Delome said that Rape Crisis Outreach focuses much of its  counseling on the parents of child victims because they are the ones who must  help their children deal with what happened day in and day out.<br>
        <br>
  &ldquo;Their parents are their primary support group, so we try to  instruct them on how to help their child. We help them, too, because a lot of  times the parents are just as traumatized as the child,&rdquo; Delome said.<br>
  <br>
        Emily Williams, coordinator and forensic interviewer at the  Children&rsquo;s Advocacy Center in Lake Charles, said that the perpetrator in 90  percent of child sexual abuse cases is a person the child knows.<br>
        <br>
        The Children&rsquo;s Advocacy Center, which serves the five area  parishes, handles interviews of child and adult mentally handicapped victims  for several local police agencies, including the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff&rsquo;s  Office. Williams said the center offers a friendlier place to interview a child  than a hospital or police station, reducing trauma.<br>
        <br>
        Last year the center interviewed 337 victims for sexual  abuse, Williams said.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>The future of  treatment</strong><br>
        Elizabeth Zaunbrecher, one of the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office&rsquo;s six  full-time sex-crimes detectives, said there&rsquo;s no way to accurately explain the  increase of cases in July. But after working with sex crimes victims for seven years,  Zaunbrecher said she hopes it is a sign that more victims are coming forward.  Statistically, only one in 10 rape cases is reported.<br>
        <br>
  &ldquo;Through education we&rsquo;ve now learned that it&rsquo;s not the  victim&rsquo;s fault, and people report more because that stigma has been lifted,&rdquo;  Zaunbrecher said.<br>
        <br>According to a listing at sane-sart.com, Lake Charles is only one of four cities in Louisiana with SANE-SART programs. The others are New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Independence.<br>
        <br>
        After observing the program&rsquo;s success in Lake Charles, American Legion Hospital in Jennings will soon have one, too.<br>
        <br>
        Eleanor East, emergency room supervisor, said the hospital ordered a colposcope Friday morning and is now planning training sessions for SANE nurses.<br>
        <br>East, who became familiar with the program from working in Texas, said she&rsquo;s been wanting to become a SANE nurse for 10 years.</p>
