  <h2>An ancient tradition:<br>
      Tournoi revives joust competitions of Europe</h2>
    

<p><strong>Published Oct. 16, 2006, in the Opelousas <em>Daily World</em></strong></p>
<p>VILLE PLATTE — Strong winds and a  steady drizzle of rain might have annoyed visitors of the Tournoi de la Ville  Platte, but it didn't stop them from coming out to watch their  &quot;knights&quot; in shining costumes compete for the championship.<br>
  <br>
  On Sunday afternoon, people gathered  at the Industrial Park in Ville Platte to watch the Tournoi, an annual ring  jousting tournament. The &quot;knights&quot; of the Tournoi compete each year  to become the champion and receive an award from the Tournoi Queen.<br>
  <br>
  The weather was less than perfect on  Sunday, but the turnout was good, said Shelly Boulet, president of the Ladies  Auxiliary. The event was originally scheduled to start at 3 p.m., but  organizers of the event decided to start an hour early to beat the rain.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;The turnout is very good this  year considering the weather,&quot; Boulet said. &quot;I'm pretty  amazed.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The Tournoi is a Ville Platte  tradition that many get excited about each year. Boulet said that most of the  20 competitors in this year's event are returning participates, although a few  of them are new.<br>
  <br>
  One of the competitors, Jarred  Matte, who was competing for his third year, said the Tournoi is a lot of fun  for him.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;It's always fun to come out  and spend time with people you don't see all of the time,&quot; he said.<br>
  <br>
  Some people at the Tournoi sat under  tents to shield them from the wind and sprinkling rain. Tonya LeDoux of Eunice,  and her three young girls, huddled in the back of their SUV to watch the riders  on the field. They had attended the Louisiana Cotton Festival Parade earlier  that day.<br>
  <br>
  The girls, Cassidy, 8, Adrian, 6,  and Jenna, 2, were make believing that they were each one of the three Tournoi  queens -- Jordan, Reed, the Teen Tournoi Queen, Britney Reed, the Louisiana  Tournoi Queen, and Brooke Anderson, the Junior Tournoi Queen.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Look it's you,&quot; one of  the girls told her sister, pointing to one of the queens walking on the field.<br>
  <br>
  LeDoux said she had heard of the  Tournoi in the past, but this is the first year she's made it to the event. She  decided to take the girls along, because she thought it would be educational.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;I think it's a good cultural  experience for the kids,&quot; she said. &quot;This is the kind of stuff  they'll eventually be learning in school.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  According to the tournament's Web  site, louisianatournoi.com, the competition began in Ville Platte in the early  1800s by Frenchman Marcellin Garand, an officer in Napoleon's army and founder  of the city. Garand turned the Tournoi into a major sporting event, and people  would travel miles to attend the tournaments.<br>
  <br>
  After about 90 years of tournaments,  the Tournoi died out until it was revived in 1943 by Ville Platte residents  J.D. Buller and Jules Tate. At this point, it was celebrated in conjunction  with Fourth of July events, but later it was moved to coincide with the  Louisiana Cotton Festival.<br>
  <br>
  In the Tournoi, the competitors wear  silver costumes to represent armor worn by the knights of old. They ride  horseback around a semicircular track, carrying long spears.<br>
  <br>
  The object of the competition is to  spear the rings that are suspended from poles around the track. There are seven  rings, which symbolize the seven enemies of cotton — flood, drought, boll  weevil, bollworm, silk, rayon and nylon.<br>
  <br>
  The &quot;knights&quot; compete in  three heats and are scored based on how many rings they spear and how quickly  they ride around the track. The competitor who spears the largest number of  rings in the shortest amount of time becomes the champion.<br>
  <br>
  This year's Tournoi competitors were  Chuck Manual, Travis Lafleur, Dexter Morien, Tim Thibodeaux, Dustin Douget,  Gary Brignac, Jean Dous, Jarred Matte, Warren Fontenot, Nick Ortego, Cody  Lafleur, Paul Fontenot, Kent Saucier, Riley Blanchet, Bryan Fontenot, Riley  Blanchet, Bryan Fontenot, Shane Trahan, Glen Marcantel, Ryan Vidrine, Boyd Landreneau,  and last year's winner, Jody Fontenot.</p>
